    "\n",
    "If we were to keep track of all Nobel laureates in a Python or Java program, and didn't know about relational databases, we would probably define classes for the laureates, and put them in lists. We could also define classes for the categories, and have one list for each category, or have lists with one element per year, and somehow track all laureates in that year, or use some kind of dictionaries/maps. However we chose to keep track of the data, some searches, insertions and deletions would be easy to implement, and some would be cumbersome. We'd also have to be careful to keep our data consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we'll use a technique which may at first seem too simple to be useful, but which turns out to be *incredibly* powerful. We're going to use [_relational databases_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database), and we'll store the data in 'simple' [_tables_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_(database)).

    "\n",
    "One basic idea of relational databases is that all 'cells' in a table should be simple values (no lists or objects), and that we can use simple operations from [_relational algebra_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra) to get information from it.\n",
    "We do it using a programming language which is highly specialized for manipulating and extracting information, it is called [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), which is short hand for _Structured Query Language_. SQL can be pronounced as either \"S-Q-L\", or \"sequel\".\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    " + _Data Definition Language_ (_DDL_): constructs used to define the tables of a database,\n",
    "\n",
    " + _Data Manipulation Language_ (_DML_): statements used to query and manipulate data in a database,\n",
    "   \n",

    "   \n",
    " + _Data Control Language_ (_DCL_): commands used to controll access to our data (we'll will not deal with them in this course).\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we'll focus on \"Data Manipulation\", i.e., ways to query and modify our databases -- next week we'll look at how to design and create our databases, and then use DDL to define our tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin by discussing the following operations from relational algebra:\n",
    "\n",
    " + _selection_: choosing some of the rows of a table\n",
    "\n",
    " + _projection_: choosing some of the columns of a table\n",

    "We will then see various ways to refine and combine queries.\n",

    "\n",
    "## An actual DBMS\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different Relational Database Management Systems ([RDMBS:es](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database)) which implements SQL, some of the most prominent are:\n",
    "\n",
    " *  [PostgreSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL)\n",
    " *  [MariaDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MariaDB)\n",
    " *  [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL)\n",
    " *  [Oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Database)\n",
    " *  [Microsoft SQL Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server)\n",
    " *  [IBM DD2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Db2_Family)\n",
    " *  [SQLite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the systems above are [_client-server_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model)-systems, i.e., they have one program, a SQL server, which handles the data, and clients who communicate with the server in various ways. There are several different kinds of clients:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ We can run an IDE, which allows us to see our tables in a GUI.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ We can run command line clients (CLI) -- they are text based programs who work like typical REPLs, output will just be text in a terminal window.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ We can write scripts which we send to the server, often through a CLI.\n",
    "  \n",
    "+ We can run a notebook (such as this one), and have it communicate with our database.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ We can write code in a general purpose language, and have it communicate with our database.\n",
    "  \n",
    "In the course, we'll try all of these methods to access our databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RDMBS we'll use in the course is [SQLite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite), which is a lightweight but still very powerful system -- it is *by far* the most used RDBMS, and it's probably already running on all of your phones and computers (just as an example, if you use Chrome for browsing, your browsing history is typically saved in a SQL-database file `.config/google-chrome/Default/History `, and Mozilla use it for storing meta-data in Firefox and Thunderbird).\n",
    "It's actually not a client/server system (instead it is a library which keeps our databases in files on our computer) -- but in the course, we'll think of SQLite as if it were a traditional client/server system, because in many ways, it behaves as one.\n",

    "So, it does look as if we could extract the countries as well, and put them into a seperate 'look-up'-table, but if Sarajevo were to hold the olympics in the future, it wouldn't be in Yugoslavia anymore, and Moscow is no longer in the Soviet Union, so just extracting the countries as we did with continents above would not work. There is a kind of database called _temporal databases_, which is designed to handle cases such as this, but we'll only briefly touch upon them in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "And there is another, more fundamental reason for keeping both name and country: the names of cities aren't globally unique, there is a Paris in Texas, and a Moscow in Kansas, so the country helps us identify the cities uniquely (a _key_ is something which lets us identify values uniquely, we'll discuss keys next week, and then in week 4, when we give a more formal definition of the concept).\n",

    "**Exercise:** _How could we add information about academic affiliations for the Nobel laureates?_ Some of the laureates have many affiliations, and some have none -- and observe that the 'cells' of our table must only contain simple values, so no lists or objects. Don't spend to much time to come up with a solution for this -- we haven't yet discussed the mechanism we're going to use to solve it -- but it's a good thing if you can see the limitations of what we've seen so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** SQL allows us to use the value `NULL` when a value is missing, so for laureates without any affiliation, we can just use `NULL` (although doing it is somewhat controversial, and we can define our tables in a way which prohibits it -- more about that later).\n",
    "\n",
    "But handling laureates with several affiliations is more difficult. One very primitive way of doing it, would be to add several columns: `affiliation_1`, `affiliation_2`, ..., but it's not only ugly, it only works if we limit the number of affiliations to a fixed number.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out we can solve this problem in a manner similar to how we handled continents above: we can add another table (a 'look-up'-table), but this time the look-up table would have all affiliations for each laureate, so it could have several rows for each laureate.\n",

    "The term [redundancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(linguistics)) can be defined in many contexts, in general it refers to information which is expressed more than once.
